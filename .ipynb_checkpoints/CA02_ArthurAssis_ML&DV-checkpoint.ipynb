    "Retailing is the selling of goods and services to consumer end users, according to ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA. Since internet has become nearly indispensable in peoples lives, mechanisms to use it to enhance sales and increase profits has been developed and optimized. Nowadays, the aquisition of data from users permitted companies to achieve a certain level of knowledge about people navigating through internet that has made possible to them to create a customized experience to each person, turning them in potential customers. This experience comes often through advertising, customized according to each person personal data collected from diverse sources, including navigating history, previous online purchase activity, and even data collected from microphones in our mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies pay for this data, and they pay sources of information that gather viewers to include advertising in their websites leading to retailers profits.  For instance, according to (Coppola, 2023), Amazon has spent over 20 billion dollars in advertising and other promotional costs. To use this data in an efficient way, making the most out of advertising, retailers use Machine Learning models to understand peoples preferences, and recommend products according to behavior and to their personal data. These Machine Learning models are called Recommendation Systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that will be explored in this project can be found in the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions/data?select=interactions_validation.csv, and it refers to data collected from a website that provides culinary recipes to users, in a format of a blog. The dataset was chosen because it contains similar features to retailers. Although it does not aim to sell its recipes, blogs are one of the sources targeted by companies to expose advertising. According to (Mimi Polner, 2023), blogs can be used to bring in sales or an income, and bloggers bring in an average annual income of $37,073. Some of the ways explored by the article that brings income to bloggers are Advertising Networks, Digital Products, Affiliate Links or Codes and Premium Content. We can therefore, consider blogs as a direct advertising retail business, in which the blogger aim to sell space for advertising in its website, and the quality of the content and experience will bring in more viewers, potentially increasing profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first verified our dataset, we noticed it contains 231,637 recipes! That may generate confusion on users that might head towards a more classified source of information. This is when recommendation systems comer to action. It is able to analyse customers preferences and recommend them customized content, so that they can increase interaction and improve experience with the website. As we will verify below, this can be achieved based exclusively on the content previously consumed by the user, called content based recommendation system, or based in content previously consumed by other users with similar interests to the first, called collaborative recommendation system."

He discusses that some words on our ingredients do not contribute to our recommendations, such and some words that are very common in almost every recipe, such as oil, and weights and measures. Furtermore, he discusses that some words might appear in singular and plural, or using gerunds, suggesting lemmatization as a solution for the issue.

    "Collaborative Filtering, different of content recommendation systems, do not use products data to find similary among products. Instead, it uses data from different users, and based on what users like or dislike, the recommendation is made. There are two mechanisms on Collaborative Filtering that can be used to create recommendations, the user-based and the item-based. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that although item-based may sound like a recommendation based on features of the products, it is not. Both of them are based in the similarity of users previous actions, rather than the content of the product. For instance, in our business case, we may discover that users that have rated chicken based recipes, have also rated nuts based recipes. Once a new user access the system and rate by the first time a chicken recipe, our recommendation system will recommend nuts based recipe, rather for the similarity between users preferences than for the similarity between the recipes itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "What differs item-based and user-based collaborative filtering, is the method used to calculate the similarity between the rating. While in user-based, the filter will consider users that liked the same recipes as the criteria to recommend, in item-based, the filter will consider recipes that are likely enjoyed together by users to recommend. \n",

    "In the first step, we want to filter back in our interactions dataset, only reviews that were written to recipes in our list of relevant recipes. To do it, we first first convert our recipe_id from our relevant recipes dataset into a list, according to suggested by (Naveen(NKK), 2023), and then we filter our interactions dataset to only recipes that are inside the list created, as suggested by (Cloud, 2023)."
